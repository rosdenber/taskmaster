# TaskMaster UI Improvement Plan

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Edit index.html to add Google Fonts link for Poppins font.
- [x] Edit src/index.css to import Tailwind CSS, set global font to Poppins, and configure dark background.
- [x] Edit src/App.jsx to replace CSS classes with Tailwind classes for centered card layout, spacing, dark mode theme, typography, input/button design, task list styling, animations, task counter badge, and empty state.
- [x] Add new features to src/App.jsx: checkbox for each task to mark as completed (with strike-through), and a simple progress bar.
- [x] Run the dev server to test the styled app and verify animations, responsiveness, and dark mode.
